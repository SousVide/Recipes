This recipe produces soft boiled eggs, but the whites will not be hard like with traditional egg whites. In theory you could use an additional step to finish hardening the whites but maintain the soupy inner yolk.

Heat sous vide bath to 140 degrees. Once it's up to temperature, place unbroken eggs in the water. You can use a spoon to lower them to the bottom of the container. If you are concerned you might break them, you can place them in a ziplock before putting them in the sous vide bath. Cook for 50 minutes.

When complete, simply break open the egg and pour it out.

These eggs are extremely soupy, so you will want to put them on some toast or a potato latke.
